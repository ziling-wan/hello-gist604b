## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create Github repository and files, and manage
- How Issues help teams collaborate
- Why documentation matters in open source projects

## Challenges and Solutions
[Describe 1-2 challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Examples: creating folders in GitHub, understanding the two-repository workflow, writing markdown]
- Writing markdowns: I still couldn't remeber all the markdown formats, I overcame it by frequently checking the markdwon rule.
- Purpose of files: I learned the purpose of creating different files.
  
## Connection to My GIS Career
[Explain in 2-3 sentences how GitHub skills will help you in your GIS career. Think about portfolio building, collaboration, contributing to open source projects]
- Open-source projects for research or educational purposes: It will help me to better understand if we would like to create a open-source platform for research or educational purposes, GitHub is necessary for repository of all the codes.
- Collabortation: Even if I may not be the developer role in future research project, it's helpful that I learn the logic and principle behind GIS open source so that I can collaborate with other developers more smoothly when building a open source platform.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
